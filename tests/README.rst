Mu Tests
========

We aim for 100% test coverage - it means someone has expressed an opinion about
how all the code paths for the application should behave.

The tests are organised to mirror the structure of the application itself.

To run the test suite, ensure you're in the *root* directory of the repository
and run the following command::

    $ make check
