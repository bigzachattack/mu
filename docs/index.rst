What?
-----

Mu is a very simple code editor for kids, teachers and beginner programmers.
It's written in Python and works on Windows, OSX, Linux and Raspberry Pi.

Why?
----

There isn't a cross platform Python code editor that is:

* Easy to use;
* Accessible to everyone;
* Available on all major platforms;
* Well documented (even for beginners);
* Simply coded;
* Currently maintained; and,
* Thoroughly tested.

Mu addresses these needs.

How?
----

Mu's outlook is:

* Less is more (remove all unnecessary distractions);
* Keep it simple (so Mu is easy to understand);
* Walk the path of least resistance (Mu should be easy);
* Have fun (learning should be a positive experience).

Mu's own code is simple and monolithic - it's commented and mostly found in a
few obviously named Python files. This has been done on purpose: we want
teachers and kids to take ownership of this project and organising the code in
this way aids the first steps required to get involved (everything you need to
know is in four obvious files).
